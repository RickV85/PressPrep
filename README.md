# PrepPress

## Abstract

PressPrep consolidates the latest news articles from the New York Times in
an adaptive user interface that allows a user to browse the latest news
from wherever they may be. The user can quickly decide what type of
headlines that they would like to browse, view more details and then
be linked directly to the full article on New York Times.

## Preview of the application



## Installation

In your terminal, run the following commands:

git clone git@github.com:RickV85/PressPrep.git

## Build Objectives

The app must include the following for MVP:

- A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
- Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

## Wins

- Implemented Typescript to prevent bugs
- Added E2E testing for all user stories with Cypress
- Completed build to match Figma design
- Adaptive user interface allows a user to view on mobile devices
